# CV-Project

In this work, an attempt was made to train a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for the purpose of recognizing and tracking car license plates. The model was trained under different conditions in order to appreciate some differences in its results. The most interesting part is to observe the training method and how this can then be reflected in the results obtained in terms of accuracy and loss metrics. Once the training was completed, a small experiment was also performed with a demo video in which Yolo's integrated tracker was tested.
